## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Motivation

The widespread use of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in various civilian and commercial sectors has introduced significant challenges for airspace monitoring and security. Unlike larger aircraft, small UAVs often possess a limited radar cross-section and exhibit unique motion characteristics, making them difficult to detect with traditional radar systems. This project aims to address these challenges by investigating the application of commercial radar development platforms for advanced small UAV detection research.

### 1.2 System Overview

The current implementation utilizes the Analog Devices CN0566 phased array radar development platform as the hardware foundation. The system architecture separates data acquisition and signal processing functions across two computing platforms to explore the trade-offs between real-time processing constraints and algorithm complexity.

**Hardware Components:**

- ADALM-PLUTO Software-Defined Radio (SDR)
- CN0566 Phased Array Antenna Board (8-element)
- ADF4159 Phase-Locked Loop for FMCW synthesis
- Raspberry Pi 4 (embedded control platform)
- Laptop computer (signal processing platform)

### 1.3 Software Architecture

The current software implementation employs a distributed processing approach:

```

└─────────────────┘                  └──────────────────┘
```

This architecture allows for investigation of computationally intensive signal processing algorithms on the laptop platform while maintaining real-time data acquisition on the embedded system.

The transmitter code is implemented in `pi_transmitter.py` on the Raspberry Pi, handling data acquisition and transmission, while the receiver and processing code is in `radar_dashboard.py` on the laptop, managing signal processing and visualization.

## 2. Raspberry Pi Data Acquisition Module (`pi_transmitter.py`)

### 2.1 Module Overview

The Raspberry Pi component handles hardware control and data acquisition functions. The current implementation focuses on establishing reliable data collection and transmission capabilities while exploring various radar operating modes.

**Primary Functions:**

1. Hardware initialization and configuration
2. FMCW waveform generation and transmission
3. Phased array beam steering control
4. Real-time I/Q data acquisition
5. Network-based data transmission
6. MAVLink protocol integration (experimental)

### 2.2 Hardware Configuration

The current implementation builds upon established CN0566 reference designs, with parameter selection based on small UAV detection requirements:

```python
CONFIG = {
    'hardware': {
        'SAMPLE_RATE': 2e6,           # 2 MHz sampling rate
        'CENTER_FREQ': 2.1e9,         # 2.1 GHz IF frequency
        'OUTPUT_FREQ': 10.25e9,       # 10.25 GHz RF output
        'CHIRP_BW': 500e6,            # 500 MHz bandwidth
        'RAMP_TIME': 500,             # 500 μs chirp duration
        'RX_GAIN': 40,                # Receiver gain setting
        'NUM_AZ_ELEMENTS': 8,         # 8-element phased array
    }
}
```

The 500 MHz bandwidth selection provides approximately 0.3-meter range resolution, which is being investigated for its suitability in small UAV detection scenarios where high spatial resolution may be beneficial for target discrimination.

### 2.3 Beamforming Implementation

The current beamforming implementation utilizes the CN0566's built-in phase control capabilities to investigate electronic beam steering:

```python
def apply_beamforming_enhanced(az_angle):
    """Beamforming implementation for azimuth scanning"""
    rf_freq = CONFIG['hardware']['OUTPUT_FREQ']
    element_spacing = 0.015  # 15mm spacing
    c = 3e8

    # Calculate phase progression for 8-element array
    k = 2 * np.pi * rf_freq / c
    phase_progression = k * element_spacing * np.sin(np.radians(az_angle)) * element_indices

    # Apply to CN0566 hardware
    my_phaser.set_beam_phase_diff(phase_diff_deg)
```

The `apply_beamforming_enhanced` function implements electronic beam steering by calculating the required phase progression across the 8-element phased array based on the desired azimuth angle. It uses the wave number and element spacing to determine phase shifts, applies Blackman window tapering to minimize sidelobes and improve beam pattern quality, and sets the phase differences on the CN0566 hardware. This enables variable beam positioning within ±60° azimuth coverage with an approximate 2° resolution, facilitating precise scanning for small UAV detection.

### 2.4 Data Transmission Approach

The current implementation addresses the challenge of transmitting high-rate I/Q data over standard network infrastructure:

```python
def safe_chunk_data(rx_data, max_samples_per_chunk=800):
    """Data chunking for UDP transmission"""
    # Split large I/Q datasets into manageable UDP packets
    # Addresses network MTU limitations
```

The `safe_chunk_data` function addresses high-rate I/Q data transmission by splitting datasets into UDP packets with a maximum of 800 samples per chunk and 50KB packet size to prevent fragmentation, utilizing UDP for low-latency transfer despite potential reliability trade-offs. Ongoing investigations evaluate these parameters for optimal performance in real-time radar data streaming, balancing bandwidth constraints with data integrity requirements.

### 2.5 MAVLink Integration (Experimental)

An experimental MAVLink interface has been implemented to investigate adaptive radar operation based on platform motion:

```python
def mavlink_listener(udp_socket, laptop_ip, laptop_port):
    """Experimental MAVLink interface for adaptive operation"""
    # Monitors aircraft speed and GPS status
    # Investigates automatic profile switching
    # Explores scan pattern adaptation
```

The `mavlink_listener` function provides an experimental MAVLink interface that monitors aircraft speed and GPS status to enable adaptive radar operations, including automatic profile switching and scan pattern adjustments based on velocity. This integration with standard autopilot systems is being explored to enhance radar performance in dynamic airborne scenarios, facilitating seamless adaptation to changing flight conditions.

### 3.2 FMCW Signal Processing Implementation

The current signal processing implementation explores various techniques for FMCW radar data analysis:

```python
def enhanced_range_doppler_processing(iq_ch0, iq_ch1, use_mti=True):
    """FMCW processing pipeline under development"""
    # 1. Reshape data into chirp matrix format
    # 2. Apply moving target indication (MTI) filtering
    # 3. Range FFT with windowing functions
    # 4. Doppler FFT for velocity analysis
    # 5. Generate range-Doppler map
```

The `enhanced_range_doppler_processing` function implements a comprehensive FMCW processing pipeline that reshapes I/Q data into chirp matrices, applies optional MTI filtering to remove static clutter, performs windowed range FFT for distance measurement, executes Doppler FFT for velocity estimation, and generates detailed range-Doppler maps. This pipeline is under ongoing development to optimize each stage for small UAV detection, with investigations into various window functions and MTI approaches to enhance resolution and target discrimination in cluttered environments.

### 3.3 Target Detection Algorithm Development

The current implementation includes several Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) detection methods under evaluation:

```python
def advanced_cfar_detection(range_doppler_magnitude, cfar_method='average'):
    """CFAR detection methods under evaluation"""
    # Investigating: average, greatest, smallest, false_alarm methods
    # Exploring adaptive guard and reference cell sizing
    # Developing 2D CFAR for range-Doppler maps
```

The `advanced_cfar_detection` function applies various Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) methods to range-Doppler magnitude maps, including average, greatest, smallest, and false alarm rate controlled variants, with adaptive guard and reference cell sizing for 2D processing. This implementation is being evaluated to determine the most effective approach for detecting small UAVs while maintaining low false alarm rates, through comparisons of algorithm performance in different noise environments and ongoing refinements to thresholding mechanisms.

### 3.4 Micro-Doppler Analysis Development

An experimental micro-Doppler analysis capability is under development to investigate small UAV detection:

```python
def enhanced_drone_micro_doppler_classification(rd_map_complex_history, target_indices):
    """Experimental micro-Doppler analysis for UAV detection"""
    # 1. Investigating rotor blade flash detection (10-200 Hz)
    # 2. Exploring harmonic analysis for propeller signatures
    # 3. Developing spectral spread analysis techniques
    # 4. Researching micro-motion pattern recognition
```

The `enhanced_drone_micro_doppler_classification` function implements advanced micro-Doppler analysis by applying Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to the complex range-Doppler history for selected targets. It detects rotor blade flashes in the 10-200 Hz range through periodic signature identification, performs harmonic analysis to identify propeller-induced modulations, measures spectral spread for micro-motion characterization, and employs pattern recognition techniques to classify potential UAV targets. This approach aims to distinguish drones from other moving objects based on their unique propulsion signatures, with ongoing refinements to improve accuracy in varied environmental conditions.

**Preliminary Investigation Results:**

- Initial testing suggests potential for UAV detection in controlled environments
- Classification accuracy varies significantly with range and environmental conditions
- Processing latency remains a challenge for real-time implementation

### 3.5 Multi-Target Tracking Development

A Kalman filter-based tracking system is under development to investigate multi-target tracking capabilities:

    # State vector: [x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, ax, ay, az]
    # Investigating micro-Doppler integration
    # Exploring adaptive noise models
```

The `EnhancedKalmanTracker` class implements a 9-state extended Kalman filter for multi-target tracking, maintaining states for position (x, y, z), velocity (vx, vy, vz), and acceleration (ax, ay, az) to predict and update target trajectories. It incorporates adaptive noise models tailored to different target types, experimental integration of micro-Doppler signatures for enhanced classification, track quality assessment methods to evaluate reliability, and maneuver detection algorithms to handle sudden changes in target motion. This tracker is designed to improve accuracy in dynamic environments, with ongoing evaluations to refine its performance for small UAV scenarios.

### 3.6 Object Classification Research

An experimental object classification system is being developed to investigate automated target categorization:

```python
def classify_semantic_object(cluster_df, environment_mode):
    """Experimental classification with confidence scoring"""
    # Investigating point cloud cluster analysis
    # Exploring classification categories and methods
    # Developing confidence scoring approaches
```

The `classify_semantic_object` function performs experimental semantic classification on clustered point cloud data using environmental context, analyzing features like size, motion patterns, and micro-Doppler signatures to categorize detections into UAVs, moving objects, static structures, or unknown types with associated confidence scores. This research focuses on developing robust classification methods that integrate multiple data sources for improved accuracy, with ongoing evaluations to assess performance across different scenarios and refine category boundaries for better reliability in real-world applications.

The 3D visualization implementation features a semi-transparent cone for field-of-view, concentric range rings for distance references, active beam indicators, configurable color-coded detection points, experimental voxel representations, and tracking elements like bounding boxes and velocity vectors. The color scheme under development uses red for UAVs, green for moving objects, orange for static ones, cyan for structures, and purple for unclassified detections, with ongoing evaluations to optimize these approaches for different research and operational scenarios.

### 4.3 Control Interface Development

The control interface provides access to various system parameters and visualization options:

The control interface includes system monitoring with network status, scan progress, and mode displays; parameter controls for data sources, environmental profiles, color schemes, display toggles, and performance modes; and adjustable settings like point size, voxel resolution, object sizing, and SNR thresholds. This evolving design incorporates user feedback to provide flexible control over visualization and system parameters, supporting adaptive operations in various research and development contexts.

### 4.4 Diagnostic Visualization Tools

Multiple diagnostic views have been implemented to support algorithm development and system analysis:

The diagnostic visualization tools include a range-Doppler heatmap for velocity-distance analysis, elevation angle distributions, top-down bird's-eye views, experimental micro-Doppler displays, and waterfall range profile histories. These multiple perspectives support algorithm development and system analysis by enabling detailed examination of radar data from various angles, facilitating performance evaluation and refinement in research settings.

### 4.5 Information Display Panels

Several information panels provide real-time system status and analysis results:

The information display panels feature experimental micro-Doppler analysis with blade frequency estimates, confidence metrics, signal strength, and preliminary classifications; object tracking details including IDs, statuses, detection counts, and estimates; system status indicators for detections, beam direction, tracks, and scans; and performance metrics like latency, CPU/memory usage, and optimization levels. These panels provide comprehensive real-time insights to support operations, algorithm development, and system performance analysis.

## 5. Signal Processing Algorithm Development

### 5.1 Multipath Mitigation Research

An experimental multipath suppression algorithm is under development:

```python
def coherent_multipath_suppression(range_doppler_history, coherence_threshold=0.8):
    """Experimental multipath suppression using multi-frame coherence"""
    # Investigating phase consistency analysis across frames
    # Exploring incoherent multipath attenuation
    # Developing direct-path signature preservation
```

The `coherent_multipath_suppression` function implements an experimental multipath mitigation technique by analyzing phase consistency across multiple range-Doppler frames, using a configurable coherence threshold to attenuate incoherent signals typically associated with multipath reflections while preserving stable direct-path signatures. This approach explores multi-frame coherence metrics to differentiate between reliable target echoes and environmental multipath artifacts, aiming to enhance overall detection performance in complex environments with ongoing research into optimal threshold selection and preservation techniques.

### 5.2 Moving Target Indication (MTI) Development

Multiple MTI processing approaches are being investigated:

```python
def enhanced_mti_processing(radar_data_history, mti_mode='3pulse'):
    """MTI processing methods under investigation"""
    # Exploring 2-pulse and 3-pulse cancellation
    # Investigating static clutter removal
    # Developing moving target preservation techniques
```

The `enhanced_mti_processing` function implements Moving Target Indication through configurable modes like 2-pulse and 3-pulse cancellation, subtracting consecutive radar frames to remove static clutter while preserving signals from moving objects. This approach investigates optimal cancellation strategies for different scenarios, focusing on effective static background suppression without attenuating slow-moving targets such as hovering UAVs, with continued development to refine techniques for various environmental conditions.

### 5.3 Temporal Filtering Research

Temporal consistency filtering is being explored to improve detection reliability:

```python
def apply_temporal_coherence_filter(frame_history):
    """Experimental temporal consistency filtering"""
    # Investigating spatial grid analysis across frames
    # Exploring false alarm reduction techniques
    # Developing persistent target track maintenance
```

The `apply_temporal_coherence_filter` function implements temporal consistency filtering by analyzing spatial grids across multiple frame histories, applying coherence metrics to reduce false alarms from transient detections while maintaining persistent tracks for consistent targets. This research explores optimization of grid resolution and coherence thresholds to balance sensitivity and reliability, particularly for tracking small UAVs in cluttered environments, with ongoing testing to evaluate effectiveness in various scenarios.

These algorithms are currently in various stages of development and testing, with performance evaluation ongoing.
